# üìñ About

Sparrow is an anytime-anywhere code environment including a full version of Debian Linux v11.0 running in your browser on the fly. We've all experienced dependency issues and compatibility issues with having different environements on different machines. Solutions like StackBlitz WebContainers fix this but only for Node.JS environments. Sparrow aims to generalize the solution over all environments by having a complete bundled operating system. This project is made using the CheerpX WebAssembly Emulation Library.
